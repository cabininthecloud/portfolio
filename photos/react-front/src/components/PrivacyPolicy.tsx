      <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>

      <p>
        This Privacy Policy describes how we handle personal information
        collected, used, and shared when a visitor or customers acceses my
        portfolio.
      </p>

      <h3>SECTION 1 - TRANSACTIONAL INFORMATION</h3>
      <SubHead>What do you do with my information?</SubHead>

      <p>
        When you purchase something from our store, as part of the buying and
        selling process, we collect the personal information you give us such as
        your name, address and email address.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you browse our store, we also automatically receive your computer
        Internet protocol (IP) address in order to provide us with information
        that helps us learn about your browser and operating system.
      </p>

      <h3>SECTION 2 - CONSENT</h3>
      <SubHead>How do you get my consent?</SubHead>

      <p>
        When you provide us with personal information to complete a transaction,
        verify your credit card, place an order, arrange for a delivery or
        return a purchase, we imply that you consent to our collecting it and
        using it for that specific reason only.
      </p>
      <p>
        If we ask for your personal information for a secondary reason, such as
        marketing, we will either ask you directly for your expressed consent,
        or provide you with an opportunity to say no.
      </p>

      <SubHead>How do I withdraw my consent?</SubHead>

      <p>
        After you opt-in, if you change your mind, you may withdraw your consent
        for us to contact you, for the continued collection, use or disclosure
        of your information, at any time, by contacting us at{' '}
        <a href="mailto:cabininthecloud@protonmail.ch">
          cabininthecloud@protonmail.ch
        </a>
        .
      </p>

      <h3>SECTION 3 - DISCLOSURE</h3>
      <SubHead>Do you disclose my information?</SubHead>

      <p>
        We may disclose your personal information if we are required by law to
        do so or if you violate our Terms of Service.
      </p>

      <h3>SECTION 4 - ONLINE STORE</h3>

      <SubHead>Payment:</SubHead>

      <p>
        If you choose a direct payment gateway to complete your purchase, the
        online store transmits your credit card data. The store data is
        encrypted through the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard
        (PCI-DSS). Your purchase transaction data is stored only as long as is
        necessary to complete your purchase transaction. After that is complete,
        your purchase transaction information is deleted.
      </p>
      <p>
        All direct payment gateways adhere to the standards set by PCI-DSS as
        managed by the PCI Security Standards Council, which is a joint effort
        of brands like Visa, MasterCard, American Express and Discover.
      </p>
      <p>
        PCI-DSS requirements help ensure the secure handling of credit card
        information by our store and its service providers.
      </p>

      <h3>SECTION 5 - THIRD-PARTY SERVICES</h3>

      <p>
        In general, the third-party providers we use will only collect, use, and
        disclose your information to the extent necessary to allow them to
        perform the services they provide to us.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, certain third-party service providers, such as payment gateways
        and other payment transaction processors, have their own privacy
        policies in respect to the information we are required to provide to
        them for your purchase-related transactions.
      </p>
      <p>
        For these providers, we recommend that you read their privacy policies
        so you can understand the manner in which your personal information will
        be handled by these providers.
      </p>

      <p>
        You can opt out of targeted advertising by:
        <br />
        Google -{' '}
        <a
          target="_blank"
          rel="noreferrer"
          href="https://www.google.com/settings/ads/anonymous"
        >
          https://www.google.com/settings/ads/anonymous
        </a>
      </p>

      <p>
        In particular, remember that certain providers may be located in or have
        facilities that are located in a different jurisdiction than either you
        or us. So if you elect to proceed with a transaction that involves the
        services of a third-party service provider, then your information may
        become subject to the laws of the jurisdiction(s) in which that service
        provider or its facilities are located.
      </p>

      <p>
        As an example, if you are located in Canada and your transaction is
        processed by a payment gateway located in the United States, then your
        personal information used in completing that transaction may be subject
        to disclosure under United States legislation, including the Patriot
        Act.
      </p>

      <p>
        Once you leave our store website or are redirected to a third-party
        website or application, you are no longer governed by this Privacy
        Policy or our website&apos;s Terms of Service.
      </p>

      <SubHead>Links</SubHead>

      <p>
        When you click on links on our store, they may direct you away from our
        site. We are not responsible for the content or privacy practices of
        other sites and encourage you to read their privacy statements.
      </p>

      <h3>SECTION 6 - SECURITY</h3>

      <p>
        To protect your personal information, we take reasonable precautions and
        follow industry best practices to make sure it is not inappropriately
        lost, misused, accessed, disclosed, altered or destroyed.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you provide us with your credit card information, the information is
        encrypted using secure socket layer technology (SSL) and stored with
        AES-256 encryption. Although no method of transmission over the Internet
        or electronic storage is 100% secure, we follow all PCI-DSS requirements
        and implement additional generally accepted industry standards.
      </p>

        information may be transferred to the new owners so that we may continue
